Scripts included in this directory were used for the analyses in the article "Transposable elements have contributed human regulatory regions that are activated upon bacterial infection" (Bogdan, L, Barreiro, L, Bourque, G).

The scripts are numbered by the analysis section:
1- Enrichment of Peak-Associated Repeats (PARs) in accessible chromatin
3- Enrichment of PARs near differentially accessible genes
4- Association of PARs with QTL-regions

There are no scripts associated with section 2, as the motif analysis was performed entirely with Homer (http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/).  

See the "input_files" directory for files used as input in the different scripts.
Note that some files may need to be obtained from scratch or external sources and are not included here.
